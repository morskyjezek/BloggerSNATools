#Criteria for Selecting URLs as Seeds#

These considerations were used to identify seed URLs that provided base URLs to develop a social network of ethnomusicology-related blogs. All seed URLs were chosen from the group of 180 blogs gathered by Barbara Alge at [Blogging Ethnomusicologists](http://ethnomblogs.blogspot.com/) as of August 2014. In the criteria, "site" is used more-or-less interchangeably with "URL", but with the intent to refer to content. Note that URL is a reference, in many cases, to a CNAME DNS record and identical content may be mirrored at multiple URLs in some cases. 

  * Site has identified (or identifiable) individual or corporate creator. 
  * For initial prototype, not to exceed more than 10 seed URLs.
  * URLs ranked by most recent contributions. 
  * Site has been updated with new content within the last year (i.e., must have recent post activity between 1 August 2013 and 31 August 2014).
  * Site has more than one contribution (that is, sites with a single post were not included).
  * Site content has at least identifiable relationship to musical scholarship from an ethnomusicological perspective.
